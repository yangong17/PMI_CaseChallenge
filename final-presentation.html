            <h2>Scenario Continuation</h2>
            <p>With the final deliverables approved and implementation underway, you formally transition project ownership to the General Manager and Plant Manager. As part of standard closeout procedures, corporate leadership has requested a <b>Final Project Presentation</b> to ensure full visibility into how the project was executed.</p>
            <p>This is your opportunity to walk key stakeholders through the full lifecycle of the project. What problem did you set out to solve? What approach did you take? What challenges arose, and how were they addressed?</p>
            <p>Your presentation should effectively communicate the project's outcome and serve as a documented record of <b>Lessons Learned</b> - helping to inform future capital projects, refine internal processes, and support the development of standard operating procedures across the organization.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="presentation-requirements">
            <h2>Objective</h2>
            <p>Create a final presentation that clearly communicates your project‚Äôs journey. The presentation should be structured like a narrative: 
                identify the initial problem, explain the plan, walk through the challenges and changes, and conclude with results and reflections.</p>
            
            
            <p>Your presentation should cover:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Executive Summary:</b> (overview of the project)</li>
                <li><b>Project Objectives & Problem Statement:</b> (why the project was initiated)</li>
                <li><b>Scope & Key Planning Elements:</b> (scope, WBS, and major assumptions)</li>
                <li><b>Baseline Performance Measures:</b> (planned schedule and cost baselines)</li>
                <li><b>Risk Register & Uncertainty Analysis:</b> (risk matrix and cost uncertainty outputs)</li>
                <li><b>Change Management Record:</b> (your response to the unexpected change, decision-making process, and schedule/cost updates)</li>
                <li><b>Final Performance Report:</b> (earned value management: actual vs. planned schedule and cost)</li>
                <li><b>Lessons Learned Log:</b> (what worked, what didn‚Äôt, and recommendations for next time)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>You may submit either a PowerPoint presentation (preferably in PDF format) or a recorded video (no longer than 10 minutes) - 
                choose whichever format best represents your work and would serve as a strong addition to your personal portfolio. 
                Keep in mind that your audience will include both technical and non-technical stakeholders, so focus on clear visuals, 
                concise explanations, and key takeaways that showcase your adaptability and results.</p>
