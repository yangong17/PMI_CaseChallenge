            <h2>Scenario Continuation</h2>
            <p>With the final deliverables approved and implementation underway, you formally transition project ownership to the General Manager and Plant Manager. As part of standard closeout procedures, corporate leadership has requested a <b>Final Project Presentation</b> to ensure full visibility into how the project was executed.</p>
            <p>This is your opportunity to walk key stakeholders through the full lifecycle of the project. What problem did you set out to solve? What approach did you take? What challenges arose, and how were they addressed?</p>
            <p>Your presentation should effectively communicate the project's outcome and serve as a documented record of <b>Lessons Learned</b> - helping to inform future capital projects, refine internal processes, and support the development of standard operating procedures across the organization.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="presentation-requirements">
            <h2>Objective</h2>
            <p>Create a final PowerPoint presentation that clearly communicates your project's journey. The presentation should be structured like a narrative: identify the initial problem, explain the plan, walk through the challenges and changes, and conclude with results and reflections.</p>
            <p>Your presentation should include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Executive summary of the project</li>
                <li>Problem statement and objectives</li>
                <li>Key planning elements (scope, WBS, assumptions)</li>
                <li>Baseline schedule and cost</li>
                <li>Risk and cost uncertainty analysis</li>
                <li>Response to the unexpected change (change request, schedule & cost updates), what was your decision-making process like?</li>
                <li>Updated cost baseline diagram</li>
                <li>Final outcomes (scope delivered, actual vs. planned cost and schedule)</li>
                <li>Integrated lessons learned log, including insights on what worked, what didn't, and what you'd do differently next time</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Your audience includes both technical and non-technical stakeholders - so balance clarity with professionalism. Use clean data visualizations, brief narratives, and clear takeaways to show how your team added value and stayed adaptable.</p>
