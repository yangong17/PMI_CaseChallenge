            <h2>Business Case Overview</h2>

            <p>TractorCo is a tractor manufacturing company headquartered in Los Angeles, California. Its 120,000-square-foot manufacturing facility in El Segundo serves as the central hub for tractor production, handling everything from raw materials to final tractor assembly.</p>
            
            <p>Currently, the main bottleneck in production is the <strong>paint department</strong>. Every tractor must pass through this stage before final assembly, but the aging booth and limited capacity have slowed output. This has left upstream departments idle at times, created inefficiencies, and delayed customer orders.</p>
            
            <p>To address the issue, the General Manager would like to install a new paint booth. This project is seen as critical to restoring efficiency and meeting demand.</p>
            
            <p>You have been appointed as the <strong>Project Manager</strong> responsible for leading the effort. As the project progresses, you will need to manage competing priorities, adapt to changes, and ensure the installation stays on track.</p>
            
            <p>At the outset, you will work closely with two key stakeholders:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Scott Patton, General Manager</strong> - the senior decision maker at the El Segundo facility and sponsor of the project.</li>
              <li><strong>Ethan Beets, Plant Manager</strong> - directs daily operations and serves as a subject matter expert for the installation.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>These stakeholders will guide you early on, but as the project moves forward, additional perspectives and challenges are likely to emerge.</p>
