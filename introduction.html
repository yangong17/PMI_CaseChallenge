            <h2>Business Case Overview</h2>
            
            <p>TractorCo is a tractor manufacturing company headquartered in Los Angeles, California. Its primary production facility spans 120,000 square feet and is located in the heart of the Downtown LA Industrial District. This plant serves as the central hub for TractorCo's operations, housing everything from raw material intake to final tractor assembly.</p>

            <p>Currently, the most critical bottleneck in the production workflow lies in the <strong>paint department</strong>. All tractors must pass through this department before moving to final assembly, but its limited capacity and aging infrastructure have slowed output significantly. As a result, upstream departments frequently sit idle, leading to wasted labor, inefficient resource use, and delayed order fulfillment.</p>

            <p>You have been newly appointed as the <strong>Project Manager</strong> tasked with resolving this issue. Your objective is to lead a strategic project that addresses the bottleneck from end to end - starting with defining the problem, aligning stakeholder priorities, managing risks and constraints, and ultimately delivering a timely, cost-effective solution that improves overall throughput.</p>

            <p>For this initiative, you'll work closely with <b>two key stakeholders:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The General Manager</strong>, who serves as the plant’s senior-most decision maker. They are responsible for evaluating major improvement initiatives and pitching capital expenditure (CapEx) proposals to TractorCo’s corporate leadership.</li>
                <br>
                <li><strong>The Plant Manager</strong>, who directs day-to-day operations on the production floor.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Their insights will guide you through the project phases as you work to restore efficiency to TractorCo's production line.</p>
