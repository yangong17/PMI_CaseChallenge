            <h2>Business Case Introduction</h2>
            <p>You are the <b>project manager</b> at a forklift manufacturing company. Your main role is to ensure the right decisions are made by balancing stakeholder needs, analyzing risks and opportunities, and guiding the project toward success.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Currently, the paint department is the biggest bottleneck in production, limiting how many forklifts can be completed. This causes other departments to sit idle, wasting time and resources.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Finance wants fast results to improve the bottom line. Operations favors a long-term capital investment to upgrade equipment. Marketing is pushing for new products to boost market presence. Leadership has asked you to lead the project and propose the best solution.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Phase 1 Deliverables</h3>
            <p>In Phase 1, you will deliver:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>A Project Charter</strong> outlining objectives, scope, key stakeholders, and assumptions.</li>
                <li><strong>A Business Case</strong> recommending whether to invest in capital upgrades or develop a new product â€” ensuring your recommendation is backed by data, risk analysis, and stakeholder input.</li>
