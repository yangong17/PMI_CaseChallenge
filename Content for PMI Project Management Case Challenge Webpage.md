## Challenge Overview
The Project Management Case Study Challenge is a simulated learning experience designed to provide participants with hands-on experience working through a complete project lifecycle, from initiation to closure, guided by PMI best practices and methodologies.

While each scenario includes scaffolding in the form of templates and resources, the challenge is designed to encourage independent problem-solving. You will be expected to conduct your own research, apply critical thinking, and leverage learning tools such as **PMI Infinity** to develop and deliver your project outputs - mirroring the realities of professional project work.

Content was developed using PMIâ€™s PM Body of Knowledge (PMBOKÂ®), and in partnership with UCLAâ€™s Masterâ€™s in Applied Statistics Program.
