            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The planning phase is where the project's roadmap is created, detailing how the work will be executed, monitored, and controlled.</li>
                <li>This phase requires the most effort and coordination - containing 24 of the 49 processes outlined in the PMBOK Guide.</li>
                <li>Successful planning leads to smoother execution and control by aligning all stakeholders on the scope, schedule, cost, and risk profile of the project.</li>

            <h2>Key Processes in This Section</h2>
            <p>The following core processes of project planning will be explored through hands-on modules:</p>

            <h3>1. Create Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)</h3>
            <p>This process involves decomposing the project scope into smaller, more manageable components called work packages. The WBS clarifies what needs to be delivered and forms the foundation for scheduling, estimating, and assigning responsibilities.</p>

            <h3>2. Develop Schedule (Gantt Chart and Critical Path)</h3>
            <p>This process determines the logical sequence of project activities, estimates their durations, and creates a timeline. The Gantt chart visualizes task dependencies and highlights the critical path, which represents the longest sequence of dependent tasks that directly impacts the project end date.</p>

            <h3>3. Establish Cost Baseline</h3>
            <p>This process includes estimating costs for all activities and aggregating them into an authorized budget. The cost baseline serves as a reference point for tracking project expenditures and evaluating financial performance throughout the project.</p>

            <h3>4. Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis (Risk Heatmap)</h3>
            <p>This process assesses the probability and impact of identified risks using a structured rating system. It helps prioritize risks based on their severity and determines which ones require further analysis or immediate response planning.</p>

            <h3>5. Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis (Cost Uncertainty Analysis)</h3>
            <p>This process evaluates the potential effect of risks on project objectives using numerical techniques. It is often applied to cost estimates to understand uncertainty, model scenarios, and support contingency planning with greater confidence.</p>
