            <h2>Using PMI Infinity in the Case Challenge</h2>

            <p>
                Think of Infinity as a coach by your side rather than a teammate doing the work for you. It can help you:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Clarify Concepts:</b> If you come across terms like ‚Äúcost baseline,‚Äù or ‚Äúcritical path,‚Äù Infinity can explain what they mean in practical terms.</li>
                <li><b>Explore Best Practices:</b> You can ask for examples of how similar challenges are handled in real projects.</li>
                <li><b>Check Your Understanding:</b> Use it to confirm whether your interpretation of a concept aligns with PMI standards.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Infinity should complement your own critical thinking. The real value of this challenge is in how you make decisions, balance trade-offs, and tell the story of your project. Use Infinity to sharpen your knowledge, not replace your judgment.</p>
