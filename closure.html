            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The Closing process group marks the official end of the project. All planned work has been completed, deliverables have been accepted, and the project has achieved its objectives. This phase is about consolidating results, documenting insights, and presenting the final outcomes to stakeholders.</p>
            <p>In Closing, your team shifts focus from executing and managing work to reflecting on performance, finalizing documentation, and communicating what was accomplished. This ensures knowledge is captured and project value is communicated effectively.</p>
            <p>During this phase, the team is expected to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Prepare a final presentation that summarizes the project lifecycle, from initiation to delivery</li>
                <li>Complete a lessons learned log, integrated into the presentation, capturing successes, challenges, and key takeaways</li>
                <li>Communicate how the project aligned with its original scope, schedule, and budget - and how it responded to change along the way</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
