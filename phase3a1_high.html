        <section class="intro">
            <h2>Unexpected Challenge</h2>
            <p>Three months into implementing the high-tech paint booth solution, a critical challenge has emerged. During the final permit approval process, the local fire marshal has mandated an upgrade to the building's sprinkler system to accommodate the new paint booth installation. This unexpected requirement adds an estimated $80,000 to the project budget.</p>
            <br>
            <p>As the project manager, you must now navigate this situation while maintaining stakeholder confidence and project momentum. The challenge involves finding creative solutions to address this budget increase while keeping the project on track.</p>
