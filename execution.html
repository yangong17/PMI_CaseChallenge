            <h2>Project Execution Overview</h2>
            <p>Overview:</p>
            <p>The Execution process group is where the project plan becomes action. Teams carry out the work defined in the project management plan, aiming to meet the project's objectives. This phase involves coordinating resources, managing stakeholder communications, and ensuring quality standards are followed.</p>
            <p>As real-world conditions change, the Execution phase also requires agility. When unexpected obstacles arise or new information surfaces, the team may need to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Submit change requests for scope, schedule, or resource modifications.</li>
                <li>Update the project schedule to reflect actual progress or shifting priorities</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In summary, the execution phase is about staying responsive, making informed decisions, and ensuring alignment with the project's goals as conditions change.</p>
